    "# Data - the different types\n",
    "\n",
    "Data comes in different types, depending on your use case. For example, you may be analysing financial data relating to stocks, or looking at pictures your users have shared online on your app. No matter the type of data, it is your job, as a Machine Learning Engineer, to support the Data Engineers and Database Admins in your oganisation, to extract as much value out of this data as possible. This may be done by developing products, or supporting data scientists, analysts or other colleagues in the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structured Data\n",
    "Structured data is data that has a relationship, hence is *relational*. This means it has a strict schema which defines the structure (properties). Below, you can see an example of a table:\n",
    "\n",
    "![structured table image](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/rQvqYgcqXK0XwSOTJqvniRagp-NHZY1REdVeMREcOANpgLie3jxIlst49DYBDGFmCzOVn_UfmWNO7evAii1TxR4Krq9PtcT7PSIfGrs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of this is that it enables the data to have a structure that can be searched. However, this means that it may be difficult to change the data. For example, what if you have clients that share data with you in a variety of different ways? Having a rigid structure may mean you are unflexible to a change in demand.\n",

    "### Semi-structured Data\n",
    "This sits between structured and unstructured data. This data uses tags to enable grouping/organisation of heirarchical data. It is where some structure exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "This also is refered to as non-relational/NoSQL data. The structure will be described by a serialisation language - this can be used to write data, that is in memory, to something (an action e.g. read). Serialisation language examples include XML or JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "example of JSON:\n",
    "```JSON\n",

    "Wait, but what about if we are dealing with data that may be connected? E.g. if our picture is of a loan application that tells us about our customer?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we are able to group many smaller tasks/operations in a transaction. The benefit a transaction provides, is that if one trigger/event changes one piece of data, then the rest of the data is also changed. Also, this means if it fails, then it is able to roll back the entire series of operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g. if you look after a platform that looks after car insurance quotes, you can make sure with a transaction that an application is not completed until after the customer is underwritten.\n",

    "* how often will the data be accessed? Is it accessed by customers who want instant information, or will business users use it, who do not mind waiting a little?\n",
    "* Is the data read-only? Should we only allow certain users to be able to write to the DB\n",
