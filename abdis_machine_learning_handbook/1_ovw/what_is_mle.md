# What is Machine Learning Engineering?

If you ask someone to explain what Data Science is, they will tend to have their own interpretation of it. However, generally Data Science is split into the three key areas you can see in the image above.

This book aims to focus purely on Machine Learning Engineering, so how does that fit in? To me, Machine Learning Engineers also have a larger responsibility in combining software engineering principles into development of machine and deep learning systems. This is how an online job ad website defined it:

> `combining software engineering and data analysis, machine learning engineers enable machines to learn without the need for further programming`

I know, you are probably still a bit confused. There are a lot of roles that overlap:

Another key problem is that these definitions are not standard in industry. In one organisation, a data scientist may spend majority of their in SQL, whereas in other org they may be researching the latest industry trends and optimising models. 

This is not new, as for example, a software engineer title also has a range of responsibilities.
