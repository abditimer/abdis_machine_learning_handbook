Welcome to Abdis Machine Learning Handbook 
============================

![welcome gif](img/welcome.gif)

This notebook will aim to capture an overview of all things Machine Learning. This includes:
1. Background topics such as statistics and toolings
1. Introduction to data engineering, visualisation, machine learning, deep learning and software engineering
1. Project builds and theory explanations

I will try to make this book as beginner friendly as possible.
