But Abdi, what is Machine Learning?

In this chapter, we will try to look at the basics of what Machine Learning is. We will cover some of the theoretical knowledge required to build models, to more of the software engineering skills required to develop machine learning systems.

## History

We will begin by going back in time. Lets understand a bit more about how this field got to where it is. 

Machine Learning can trace its origins back to early history, as Machine Learning is built upon the knowledge we have gained from mathematics & in particular - statistics. Early discoveries such as [Bayes Theorom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem) and [Markov Chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) are examples of early-discoveries that we have built upon to get to where we are today. 

Whenever you read about A.I., you will always be directed to something relating to the father of theoretical computer science & A.I. - [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing). I will not go into much depth on this topic, but instead, you can find out more about him [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsdYtP0W0vw). 

In the 1940's, we saw neurophysiologist Warren McCulloch and mathematician Walter Pitts [paper](http://s-f-walker.org.uk/pubsebooks/pdfs/The_Organization_of_Behavior-Donald_O._Hebb.pdf) that described how Neurons worked. This laid the foundations for an exciting field - Deep Learning.

You can trace the term of `Machine Learning` to an ex-IBM employee in the late 50's named Arthur Samuel. He developed the worlds first self-learning program - a revolution at the time. This, was closely followed by a number of other key achievements:

The aim of this book is not to build a sophisticated historical timeline, however, it aims to introduce you to what a Machine Learning Engineer does.
